        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the privacy policy of Project_e. This document outlines how we handle your data and protect your privacy while using our mobile game. By using Project_e, you agree to the terms outlined in this privacy policy.</p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personal data from our users. The only data collected is for the purpose of serving ads through Google AdMob.</p>

        <h2>AdMob</h2>
        <p>We use Google AdMob to serve ads in our game. Google AdMob may collect and use data about your device to improve the ad experience.

    <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Although we do not specifically target our game towards children under the age of 13, we recognize that it may appeal to them. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Opting Out of Personalized Ads</h2>
<p>At this time, we do not provide a way for users to opt out of personalized ads served through AdMob. If you wish to limit ad tracking, you can do so by adjusting the settings on your mobile device:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For Android devices: Go to Settings > Privacy > Ads and enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization".</li>
    <li>For iOS devices: Go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising and enable "Limit Ad Tracking".</li>
</ul>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Since we do not collect personal data, there is no risk of personal data being compromised from our end.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
